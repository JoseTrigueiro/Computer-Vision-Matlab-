To run the program, first the experiment image sets should be downloaded from:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g_0ykAX_EsZJTUuElsp2mnfoykFf3fH3?usp=sharing

and placed on the correct folder. If all the MATLAB files are in folder ExampleFolder, the images should be saved in:

.../ExampleFolder/kitchenscene
.../ExampleFolder/roomscene

The program may then be executed by running MainScript.m and following the instructions on the command line.
